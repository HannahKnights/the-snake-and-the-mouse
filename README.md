*the snake and the mouse*

*a gentle introduction to Python through*

*poetry & scrolling words*


This is a [free online 1 hour workshop](https://forms.gle/gHZB45pGu2yePvGu6), on Sunday, August 23rd at 4 PM (EST)

The aim of this workshop is to teach a basic introduction to the Python programming language through the hands-on experience of writing some low-fi, light-weight and fun Python code. We (the mouse) will work with Python (the snake) to make some playful text-based poem-like work - taking inspiration from the form of concrete poetry.

Along the way we will pause & touch on the following ideas:

* empathetic coding
* coding with care & kindness
* writing code like writing stories
* writing code in our own [idiolect](https://www.google.com/search?q=idiolect)
* coding as your tool
* python exception handling as a model for empathy
* concrete poetry / fluxus
* de-mystifying programming


This workshop is a part of the final presentation for [Teaching as Art Online at School for Poetic Computation, Spring/Summer 2020](https://sfpc.io/teachingasart-spring2020)
