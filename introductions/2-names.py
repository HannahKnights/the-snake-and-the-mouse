python (the snake):
    - required introductions...
    - if you introduce a character, without an introduction, then python will
    let you know

* eveything requires an introduction *

    - introductions are simple !...

    i_am = 'a mouse'
    this_is = 'that'
    days_in_a_year = 365
    are_there_always_365_days_in_a_year_though = False
