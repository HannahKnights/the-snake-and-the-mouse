"""
python (the snake):
    - some words have special meaning to python:
        - if
        - for
        - until
        - while
        - etc..
    - if they find those words they expect a certain structure should follow
    - if it's not there then they won't know what to do

* some 'words' have a particular structure associated with them *

Tips:

    - if, for examples:

    today_is_a_tuesday = False

    if today_is_a_tuesday:
        print('It is Tuesday')

    parts_of_a_day = ['day','night']

    for part in parts_of_a_day:
        print('It is ' + part)

    see these example by looking at the code and/ or running:
        python introductions/3-arrangements-examples.py

python introductions/3-arrangements.py
"""

i_am = 'a mouse'

if i_am me = i_am
    print('It is so nice to meet you, ' + me)
